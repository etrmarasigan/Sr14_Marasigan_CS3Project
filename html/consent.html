      <p id="subheading"> What Is Consent</p>
      <p>According to an article by RAINN (n.d.), consent is an agreement between parties to participate in sexual activity. Consent must be clear and expressed openly. This would mean that everyone must understand one another’s boundaries and respect them as well. It should also be noted that consent doesn’t only apply to sexual activty, but also to basic things like hugging and taking pictures of other people.</p> </article>

      <p id="subheading">Why Is It Important</p>
      <p>It is important because it is part of communication and honesty which are important parts of building healty relationships. Consent serves as a reminder that everyone has their own boundaries, and it is important for other people to respect  that. It also makes everyone feel comfortable and not ashamed of their own preferences and it also frees them from the pressure to do things they wouldn’t want to do.

      <p id="subheading"> How To Practice Consent</p>
      <p>Even as students, it is important to already learn how to practice consent in your daily lives. You can always start by asking permission with things like borrowing a pencil and posting pictures of one of your classmates. It is important to learn that “no means no” and you must respect those personal boundaries.
